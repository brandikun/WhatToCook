Simple Recipe Search by Ingredients for Android using food2fork API

An example app using the retrofit library alongside picasso to display results from queries to the Food2Fork API.

Simply enter an ingredient and recipes containing that ingredient will display in a recyclerview using cardview items.

TODO: Will probably add the ability to search for multiple ingredients and to display several pages of results as well as a webview
that displays when you tap on an item.
